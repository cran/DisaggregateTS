Description: First - Generates (potentially high-dimensional) high-frequency and low-frequency series for simulation studies in temporal disaggregation; Second - a toolkit utilizing temporal disaggregation and benchmarking techniques with a low-dimensional matrix of indicator series previously proposed in Dagum and Cholette (2006, ISBN:978-0-387-35439-2) ; and Third - novel techniques proposed by Mosley, Gibberd and Eckley (2021) <arXiv:2108.05783> for disaggregating low-frequency series in the presence of high-dimensional indicator matrices.
